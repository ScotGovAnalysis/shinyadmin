# shinyadmin

The code in this repository is used to assist with administration of the Scottish Public Sector [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) account (scotland.shinyapps.io). 

## Prerequisites

1.  You must be a member of the `scotland` shinyapps.io account.

2.  You must have registered the `scotland` account in RStudio using an account token and secret. This can be done using the following code:

    ```
    rsconnect::setAccountInfo(
      name   = "scotland",
      token  = "",
      secret = ""
    )
    ```
    
3.  You must have access to the `AdministrationShinyapps` ADM database used to store the data.

4.  You must have access to the Microsoft Form used to collect contact data.


## Data

There are three sources of data:

1.  App data from the shinyapps.io server

    A snapshot of this data is taken in script 1 and written to ADM in the table `server_apps`.

2.  Contact data collected via a Microsoft Form

    A snapshot of this data is taken in script 2 and written to ADM in the table `contacts_new`.

3.  Historic contact data collected via a Google form

    This data is stored in the ADM table `contacts_old`.
    
Scripts 3 and 4 use these data sources to produce an analysis table, stored in ADM as `analysis`.


## Process

1.  Create `config.yml` file. 
 
    This file isn't tracked by git, however the expected format can be seen in `config-example.yml`.

2.  Run the scripts in the `scripts/` folder one by one in their numbered order.


## Output

These are stored in the `outputs/` folder.

1.  An Excel spreadsheet containing all available data, split by organisation.

Any additional analysis should be carried out using the `analysis` table on ADM.


## R Package

The functions defined in the `R/` folder are used to form an R package, `shinyadmin`.
